## Running programs
These programs are made to be easily run through the shell. Run the command `./launcher.sh` on your command line and select which folder you would like to run. The program will automatically run for you. 

If all you see is a blank terminal, your system must not support `dialogue`. Run the command `./launcher2.sh` instead.
